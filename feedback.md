## Lab Feedback

- Good work on the lab!
- Please make sure to put `N/A` on the [README](README.md) for the resources and collaborators section if you did not use any or talk to anyone about the assignment.
- When taking user input, you should clear the `EditText` field after the user presses submit. 
- Also, instead of setting the default text "Enter City Name", the `EditText` has a `hint` attribute that you can put this in, and the text will go away when the user starts typing, insteadd of them having to delete the default text before being able to enter what they want.
